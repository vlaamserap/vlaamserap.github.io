## About forking this repository

**Important!** Think twice before forking this repository as it is currently 750+ MB large, including 250+ MB of binary files (stats for 20 jan 2015). In the next few months all larger images will be moved to our Flickr account which should cut down on the size by 100+ MB or so.

In short, please **fork** this repository **only if you're planning to contribute on a regular basis**. As an alternative to (forking and) submitting a pull request you can:

* open an issue [here](https://github.com/vlaamserap/vlaamserap.github.io/issues) and suggest an edit
* email us at vlaamserap at gmail dot com
